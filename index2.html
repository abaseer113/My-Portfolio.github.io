            I am a passionate and dedicated individual who has always had a deep love for web development. From an early age, I was captivated by the power of web development and its ability to transform ideas into reality. This fascination has driven me to pursue a career in development, where I continually strive to push the boundaries of what is possible. 
            
            I possess a solid educational background in software development and have gained invaluable practical experience through internship at Microsoft as a developer. These experiences have not only sharpened my skills but have also provided me with a diverse perspective on development and its applications. <br>
        
            Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio website. I hope you find it informative and engaging. I look forward to connecting with you and exploring new possibilities together.</p>
